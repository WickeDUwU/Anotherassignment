                <p>No matter what we do if we dont stay focused in life than even small gust of wind can throw us off.

                    updated with current technolgy. We must planout our work hours, create our own envionment where we
                    can be comfortable and focus on our work.These are some key points to be succefull in life.

                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>Its very simple. To achive our goals. To go beyond our limits we must push ourselvs and the best
                    practice to do that is to never compare your self with anyone. Instead focus on ourselvs and be
                    better than ourselvs everyday. Set this as our mission and start grinding.</p>

                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>We must know what we are upto. Example: If I want to become a webdev then I've to learn html css
                    first not how catch fish. We should also know what's the benifiet of learning that. We ned to learn
                    how to utilize our resources. Everything must be planned out. We need to think like a visionary.</p>

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>As I mentioned. Everything must be well planned out. This year my aim is to become a full fleshed Web
                    Developer. 2022 is the year that I must become productive. Set a goal for yourselvs too and keep
                    grinding my friends ^_^</p>

                <h1>Know our <br> Global Community</h1>
                <p>Designers are responsible artists. Whether it is web designing or development it requires a sense of
                    imagination for looking at the output even before it is published.To practice to learn more about
                    developing or web dev there are many many communities out there. Where many nice people are out
                    there to correct our mistakes and to teach us on our course. We should research or google online and
                    join the ones with most active members. Joining a community is very important. Because this can
                    really help us to learn faster. If we face problem we can ask for guidence to find a solution for
                    the problem.</p>
